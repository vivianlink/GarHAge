# GarHAge
## A Home-Automation-friendly ESP8266-based MQTT Garage Door Controller

GarHage has two main functionalities: 
1. Allows 2 "dumb" garage door openers to be controlled (open/close) 
2. Report garage door status (opened/closed) via MQTT

GarHAge is almost completely compatible with Home Assistant's "MQTT Cover" platform. It responds to HASS's open and close commands and reports door status to keep HASS's GUI in sync with the door state. GarHAge does not implement HASS's "stop" command (as this functionality varies between garage door openers) or "tilt" functionality. Sample HASS configuration snippets are provided in this repository to get your garage door openers connected to HASS as quickly and painlessly as possible.

GarHAge should be controllable via any home automation software that can configure an MQTT cover, rollershutter, garage door, or send commands over MQTT, including OpenHAB.

GarHAge has both hardware and software components. The required hardware components include an ESP8266-based microcontroller (such as the NodeMCU), a relay module, and reed/magnetic switches. The software component is found in this repo.

Best of all, if you select the proper parts, building and installing a GarHAge requires **no soldering**!

## How GarHAge works...

GarHAge subscribes to a configurable MQTT topic for each of two garage doors (by default, `garage/door/1/action` and `garage/door/2/action`).

When the `OPEN` payload is received on either of these topics, GarHAge momentarily activates a relay connected to the relevant garage door opener to cause the door to open.

When the `CLOSE` payload is received on either of these topics, GarHAge momentarily activates a relay connected to the relevant garage door opener to cause the door to close. By default, GarHAge is configured to activate the same relay for the `OPEN` and `CLOSE` payloads, as most (if not all) garage door openers operate manually by momentarily closing the same circuit to both open and close.

When the `STATE` payload is received on either of these topics, GarHAge publishes the status (`open` or `closed`) of the relevant garage door to the configurable topic `garage/door/1/status` or `garage/door/2/status`. These messages are published with the "retain" flag set. _(Note: To address a current issue in Home Assistant that may result in MQTT platforms not showing the correct garage door status (open/closed) after a HASS restart, I recommend creating an automation in Home Assistant that publishes the `STATE` payload for each door on HASS start. An example is provided in the [Configuring Home Assistant](#configuring-home-assistant) section of this documentation.)_

When the state of a garage door changes (either because GarHAge has triggered the door to open or close, or because the door has been opened or closed via a remote, pushbutton switch, or manually), GarHAge publishes the status (`open` or `closed`) of the relevant garage door to `garage/door/1/status` or `garage/door/2/status`. These messages are published with the "retain" flag set.

GarHAge also publishes a "birth" message on connection to your MQTT broker, and a "last-will-and-testament" message on disconnection from the broker, so that your home automation software can respond appropriately to GarHAge being online or offline.

### Detailed Bill of Materials

#### 1. ESP8266-based microcontroller

I recommend the NodeMCU as GarHAge was developed and is tested on it. Its advantages are:
- it comes with header pins already soldered so that it can plug directly into a mini solderless breadboard;
- its VIN (or VU on the LoLin variant) port can power the 5v relay module;
- it can be powered and programmed via MicroUSB;
- it has Reset and Flash buttons, making programming easy.

Accordingly, this guide is written with the NodeMCU in mind.

But, Garhage should also work with the Adafruit HUZZAH, Wemos D1, or similar, though you may need to adjust the GPIO ports used by the sketch to match the ESP8266 ports that your microcontroller makes available.

#### 2. Dual 5v relay module

A dual 5v relay module (as opposed to individual 5v relays) makes setup easy: just plug jumper wires from the module's VCC, CH1, CH2, and GND pins to the NodeMCU. These relay modules generally also include LEDs to ease troubleshooting.

Most importantly, because the relay module is powered by 5v, its inputs can be triggered by the NodeMCU's GPIOs.

GarHAge will work with relay modules that are active-high or active-low; if using an active-low relay, be sure to set the relevant configuration parameter in config.h, described below, and test thoroughly to be sure that your garage door opener(s) are not inadvertently triggered after a momentary power-loss.

#### 3. Reed/magnetic door switches

GarHAge will work with both normally-open and normally-closed reed switches; if using a normally-closed switch, be sure to set the relevant configuration parameter in config.h, described below, to match the type of switch in use. Many switches with screw terminals are available, making placement and wiring easy.

#### 4. 5v MicroUSB power supply

Power your NodeMCU via the same type of power supply used to charge Android phones or power a RaspberryPi. Powering the NodeMCU via MicroUSB is important since the relay module can then be powered via the NodeMCU VIN (or VU on the LoLin variant) port.

#### 5. Mini solderless breadboard (170 tie-point)

The NodeMCU mounts to this breadboard nicely, leaving one female port next to each NodeMCU port and making it easy to use male-to-female jumper wires to make connections from the NodeMCU to the relay module. The bell wire attached to the reed switches will also plug into the breadboard ports, making for a clean and solderless installation. Finally, these mini breadboards often also have an adhesive backing, making mounting in your project box easy.

#### 6. - 8. Miscellaneous parts

To install GarHAge, you will also require:
- Enough bell/low voltage two-conductor wire to make connections from each reed/magnetic switch at your garage doors to where GarHAge is mounted and to make connections from GarHAge to each garage door opener.
- Male-to-female breadboard jumper wires to make connections from the NodeMCU to the dual-relay module (4 jumper wires required).
- a project box to hold both the NodeMCU and dual-relay module.

### Building GarHAge

1. Attach your NodeMCU to the middle of the mini solderless breadboard, leaving one female port next to each NodeMCU port.
2. Mount the mini solderless breadboard in your project box.
3. Mount the dual-relay module in your project box.
4. Plug a jumper wire from VCC on the relay module to VIN / VU on the NodeMCU.
5. Plug a jumper wire from GND on the relay module to GND on the NodeMCU.
6. Plug a jumper wire from CH1 on the relay module to D2 on the NodeMCU (or Arduino/ESP8266 GPIO4).
7. Plug a jumper wire from CH2 on the relay module to D1 on the NodeMCU (or Arduino/ESP8266 GPIO5).

_Done!_

If using a different ESP8266 microcontroller, follow that device's instructions for putting it into flashing/programming mode.

### 4. Check the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor

Open the Serial Monitor via `Tools - Serial Monitor`. Reset your microcontroller. If all is working correctly, you should see something similar to the following messages:

```
Starting GarHAge...
Relay mode: Active-High

Connecting to your-wifi-ssid.. WiFi connected - IP address: 192.168.1.100
Attempting MQTT connection...Connected!
Publishing birth message "online" to GarHAge/availability...
Subscribing to garage/door/1/action...
Subscribing to garage/door/2/action...
Door 1 closed! Publishing to garage/door/1/status...
Door 2 closed! Publishing to garage/door/2/status...
```

If you receive these (or similar) messages, all appears to be working correctly. Disconnect GarHAge from your computer and prepare to install in your garage.

## Installing GarHAge

1. Mount GarHAge in your garage.
2. Mount the reed switch for Door 1.
3. Run bell/low voltage wire from Door 1's reed switch to the NodeMCU; strip the wires and plug into D5 and GND.
4. Mount the reed switch for Door 2.
5. Run bell/low voltage wire from Door 2's reed switch to the NodeMCU; strip the wires and plug into D6 and GND.
6. Connect bell/low voltage wire to the NO and COMMON terminals of relay 1 on your relay module; run the wire to the garage door opener for Door 1 and connect to the opener's terminals (the same terminals that the pushbutton switch for your door is attached to).
7. Connect bell/low voltage wire to the NO and COMMON terminals of relay 2 on your relay module; run the wire to the garage door opener for Door 2 and connect to the opener's terminals (the same terminals that the pushbutton switch for your door is attached to).

_Done!_


## Configuring Home Assistant

GarHAGE supports both Home Assistant's "MQTT Cover" and "MQTT Binary Sensor" platforms.

### HASS Automation Workaround

_Testing has shown that the MQTT platform in Home Assistant sometimes does not update the status of an entity (such as the cover or binary sensor) in accordance with a retained message on the status topic on HASS start or restart. This can leave the cover entity in an "unknown" state, and the binary sensor may show "closed" even if the door is open._

_The entities will, however, update to show the correct state when the door next changes state and GarHAge publishes the state to the door's status topic._ 

_A temporary workaround (until this issue is resolved in HASS, or possibly in the underlying Paho MQTT library used in HASS) is to use an automation to send the "STATE" payload to the doors' action topics on Home Assistant start. This will ensure that the cover and binary sensor show the correct door state on HASS start and restart._

Place the following in your `automations.yaml` (adjusting if you have only one door controlled by GarHAge); replace `id: xyz` with the next sequential automation number according to your own `automations.yaml`.

```
- id: xyz
  alias: Update garage door state on startup
  trigger:
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "garage/door/1/action"
        payload: "STATE"
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: "garage/door/2/action"
        payload: "STATE"
```

### MQTT Cover: Basic configuration

```
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 1"
    state_topic: "garage/door/1/status"
    command_topic: "garage/door/1/action"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"

  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 2"
    state_topic: "garage/door/2/status"
    command_topic: "garage/door/2/action"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"
```

_Note: GarHAge's default parameters match Home Assistant's defaults and, as such, the above minimal configuration will work._

_Note: the "availability_topic" configuration parameter will be available in Home Assistant as of version 0.55; it allows Home Assistant to display the cover as "unavailable" if GarHAge goes offline unexpectedly. When GarHAge reconnects to your broker, the cover controls will again be available in Home Assistant. GarHAge forms its availability topic by suffixing "/availability" to the MQTT_CLIENTID parameter in config.h, and publishes "online" to that topic when connecting or reconnecting to the broker and "offline" when disconnecting from the broker._

### MQTT Cover: Complete configuration

_Note: If you want to guard against your GarHAge configuration breaking if a Home Assistant update changes one of its defaults, the complete configuration below can be added._

```
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 1"
    state_topic: "garage/door/1/status"
    command_topic: "garage/door/1/action"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"
    qos: 0
    optimistic: false
    retain: false
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STATE"
    state_open: "open"
    state_closed: "closed"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"

  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 2"
    state_topic: "garage/door/2/status"
    command_topic: "garage/door/2/action"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"
    qos: 0
    optimistic: false
    retain: false
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STATE"
    state_open: "open"
    state_closed: "closed"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
```

_Note: Setting_ `payload_stop` _to_ `STATE` _allows you to trigger a status update from GarHAge for a Door by pressing the stop button for that door in the HASS GUI. The stop button in the HASS GUI is otherwise unused._

### MQTT Binary Sensor

```
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 1"
    state_topic: "garage/door/1/status"
    payload_on: "open"
    payload_off: "closed"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"
    device_class: opening
    qos: 0

  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door 2"
    state_topic: "garage/door/2/status"
    payload_on: "open"
    payload_off: "closed"
    availability_topic: "GarHAge/availability"
    device_class: opening
    qos: 0  
```

_Note: the "availability_topic" configuration parameter will be available in Home Assistant as of version 0.54; it allows Home Assistant to display the binary sensor as "unavailable" if GarHAge goes offline unexpectedly. When GarHAge reconnects to your broker, the door state will again be displayed in Home Assistant. GarHAge forms its availability topic by suffixing "/availability" to the MQTT_CLIENTID parameter in config.h, and publishes "online" to that topic when connecting or reconnecting to the broker and "offline" when disconnecting from the broker._

### HASS Example Automations

In the examples that follow, replace `id: xyz` with the next sequential automation number according to your own `automations.yaml`.

#### Close garage door if open for longer than 30 minutes

Place the following in your `automations.yaml`:

```
- id: xyz
  alias: Close garage door if open for longer than 30 minutes
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
      to: "open"
      for:
        minutes: 30
  action:
    - service: cover.close_cover
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
```

Of course, you can replace `30` with any length of time in minutes you wish. Be sure to replace `cover.garage_door_1` if the  name of your garage door in Home Assistant is different.

#### Notify iOS device when garage door opens or closes

To use this automation, you must have the Home Assistant iOS app installed on your iPhone and must have the `ios:` and `notify:` platforms in your `configuration.yaml`.

Place the following in your `automations.yaml`:

```
- id: xyz
  alias: Notify iOS device when garage door opens or closes
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
  action:
    - service: notify.ios_your_device_name_here
      data_template:
        message: >
          Garage Door 1 just changed from {{ trigger.from_state.state }} to {{ trigger.to_state.state }}!
```

Replace `notify.ios_your_device_name_here` with the name assigned to your device by Home Assistant (for example, if Home Assistant knows your device as "steves_iphone", your notify statement would be: `notify.ios_steves_iphone`.

Be sure to replace `cover.garage_door_1` if the  name of your garage door in Home Assistant is different.

If you wish to notify only when the garage door either opens _or_ closes, add a `to` statement to the trigger following `entity_id` and specify either "open" or "closed", e.g.:

```
- id: xyz
  alias: Notify iOS device when garage door opens
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
      to: "open"
  action:
    - service: notify.ios_your_device_name_here
      data_template:
        message: "Garage Door 1 just opened!"
```

#### Notify iOS device when garage door is open for longer than 30 minutes, with an actionable notification

An actionable notification will raise a notification on your iPhone with a "Close Garage" button allowing you to close the garage door directly from the notification (i.e. without needing to open the Home Assistant app).

To use this automation, you must have the Home Assistant iOS app installed on your iPhone. You must also have the `notify:` platform in your `configuration.yaml`.

To the `ios:` platform in `configuration.yaml`, add:

```
ios:
  push:
  categories:
    - name: Garage
      identifier: "GARAGE"
      actions:
        - identifier: "CLOSE_GARAGE"
          title: "Close Garage"
          activationMode: "background"
          authenticationRequired: no
          destructive: yes
          behavior: "default"
```

If you want to be required to authenticate (i.e. enter your passcode or unlock with TouchID) before being able to access the "Close Garage" button, change `authenticationRequired: no` to `authenticationRequired: yes`.

You will also need to add the following two automations to your `automations.yaml`:

```
- id: xyz
  alias: Notify iOS device when garage door has been open for 30 minutes
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
      to: "open"
      for:
        minutes: 30
  action:
    - service: notify.ios_your_device_name_here
      data:
        message: "Garage Door 1 has been open for 30 minutes!"
        data:
          push:
            category: "GARAGE"

- id: xyz
  alias: Close garage when triggered from iOS notification
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: ios.notification_action_fired
      event_data:
        actionName: CLOSE_GARAGE
  action:
    - service: cover.close_cover
      entity_id: cover.garage_door_1
```

In the first automation, replace `notify.ios_your_device_name_here` with the name assigned to your device by Home Assistant (for example, if Home Assistant knows your device as "steves_iphone", your notify statement would be: `notify.ios_steves_iphone`.

Of course, you can replace `30` with any length of time in minutes you wish.

In both automations, be sure to replace `cover.garage_door_1` if the  name of your garage door in Home Assistant is different.

Restart Home Assistant for the configuration and automation changes to take effect.

Finally:
1. Open the Home Assistant app on your iPhone.
2. Tap the gear icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. Scroll down and tap "Notification Settings".
4. Tap "Update push settings".
5. You should receive the message: "Settings Imported". Tap "OK".

Now, when your garage door has been open for 30 minutes, you will receive a Home Assistant notification saying "Garage Door 1 has been open for 30 minutes!", and the notification will contain a button labelled "Close Garage" which will close your garage when tapped.
